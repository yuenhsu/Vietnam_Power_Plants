# Vietnam_Power_Plants
 A list of power plants in Vietnam

## Project
The repository is created for my research project that examines the current electricity supply distribution in Vietnam and proposes a more sustainable path forward. Initially, we planned to utilise existing power plant database and visualise the distribution emphasising on the policy recommendation. However, we soon realised that there are currently no complete database for power plants in Vietnam available. Therefore, the project shifted towards building a repository providing future researchers with a complete list of power plants in Vietnam as of August 2020.

## Data Source
* [WRI Global Power Plant Database](https://github.com/wri/global-power-plant-database): The database provides existing data from [Clean Development Mechanism](https://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/projsearch.html), [Global Energy Observatory](https://github.com/hariharshankar/pygeo), and other energy databases. For more information, please see the [repository](https://github.com/wri/global-power-plant-database). WRI database is the skeleton of our project providing power plants information, including energy source, capacity, coordinates, and commissioning year, for those existed before 2016. In this repository, we refer data from this database as **WRI**.
* [Vietnam Market Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nGuxqdS9x0xMEjo0YRlC8sMHg7DhSeTa/view): The 2018 market report lists all plants operating on the market by the end of 2018 with capacity in the year. This list allows us to update the information in WRI database and adds some plants that are not available in WRI. In this repository, we refer data from this database as **Market**.
* [Vietnam PDP Plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nGuxqdS9x0xMEjo0YRlC8sMHg7DhSeTa/view?usp=sharing): PDP 7 outlines a master plan for power source development. That is, a list of power plants to be constructed between 2016 to 2030. This list allows us to verify some of the information in the previous two sources and builds up a road map for Vietnam power sector up to 2030. In this repository, we refer data from this database as **PDP**.

## Processes & File Directory
All raw and processed data are stored in [`data`](https://github.com/yuenhsu/Vietnam_Power_Plants/tree/master/data) folder and the scripts are stored in the root folder.

* Raw data: 
    * `raw_wri.csv`: Data from WRI database after cleaning with `1_data_collection.py` to remove duplicates.
    * `raw_market.csv` & `raw_pdp.csv`: Manually input from official PDF documents.

* Translation & standardisation: `translation.csv` for a list of plant and fuel names in Vietnamese and English, using `2_translation.py`.

* Cleaning: Changes are documented in `edit.csv` and the script for merging three datasets are available in `3_clean_merge.py`. We made many judgement calls in this step and operated under these premises:
    * Official documents take priority. That is, if WRI data are different from Market or PDP, we will drop WRI entry.
    * If WRI data are significantly different from official data, we will verify with second resources, either from Vietnamese press release or academic research, and make decision on how to proceed.
    * Any power plants that are available in WRI only, that is, without official record, we must be able to verify with at least one local Vietnam source to consider the power plant.

* Final output: `Vietnam_Power_Plants.csv`, includes a list of existing power plants and planned power plants up to 2030 with capacity, fuel source, coordinates, and commissioning year. Please note that:
    * Power plants with commissioning year after 2020 do not have coordinates since they are not built.
    * Coordinates may be the power plants or the dem. 

Here is a snapshot of the final output:
std_name | capacity_mw | latitude | longitude | std_fuel | commissioning_year 
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
A Luoi | 170 | 16.2839 | 107.3589 | Hydro | 2012


## Analysis
After obtaining the final list, we began the analysis and research. The project goal is to provide recommendations on improving sustainability of Vietnam’s electricity grid. We first assessed the current and planned electricity grid of Vietnam​ and identified the areas for improvement. 

### Assessing the current and planned electricity grid
![](https://github.com/yuenhsu/Vietnam_Power_Plants/blob/master/image_output/01_generation_ind.png?raw=true)

The graph shows the distribution of electricity generation by fuel type from 1990 to 2030 in Vietnam, assuming all existing power plant will continue operating and not retire before 2030. Electricity generated by coal plants increases significantly from 2010 to early 2020s. While the slope decreases after 2022, more and more coal plants are planned to be constructed every year.

Similar to the previous graph, this one also shows the distribution of electricity generation. However, the stacked bar chart also shows the total power generation for each year. Given the assumption that no plants will retire, generation from all types of source increases. Either building more power plants or increasing the capacity for existing plants will result in changes in generation. As the graph provides aggregated data, it is difficult to tell whether Vietnam is building a few plants with large capacity or multiple small ones. Hence, the next graph.

The bubble chart shows the **capacity** and commissioning year for individual plants. Majority of the power plants have a capacity lower than 1000 MW. Plants with larger capacity use coal, hydro, or nuclear as the energy source. The renewable category is excluded in the previous statement because Linh and I treat it as a placeholder. We believe that Vietnamese officals have not determined how and what to build plants with renewable energy, hence the lack of plant name in PDP document, but have set a goal.

To sum, electricity supply in Vietnam has been increasing since 2000 and will continue to grow. While various energy source are utilised to increase generation, coal plants along with other fossil fuels are the biggest source. 

So, back to the research, does the current and planned grid seem to be heading to a more sustainable future? Yes and no. Yes because many plants using renewable energy will be built in the next decade. No because more coal plants will be constructed as well. This brings to the next step: what recommendations can we provide to make the energy sector slightly more sustainable? 

### Visualising distribution for recommendation
![](https://github.com/yuenhsu/Vietnam_Power_Plants/blob/master/image_output/04_plants.png?raw=true)

Firstly, we mapped all power plants with coordinates. 

![](https://github.com/yuenhsu/Vietnam_Power_Plants/blob/master/image_output/05_buffer_fossil.png?raw=true)

Secondly, we draw a buffer around all fossil plants with a diameter of 36 kilometers to demonstrate the area of pollution generated by the plants. The map shows that the fossil plants are concerntrated in the north and south. We then calculated the proportion of polluted area and multiplied the percentage with the province population, assuming the population is distributed equally across the province. 

![](https://github.com/yuenhsu/Vietnam_Power_Plants/blob/master/image_output/06_affected_pop.png?raw=true)

This is the final result. The red colour on the map shows the affected population in each province. Three provinces with the most population affected by the pollution are:
1. Ho Chih Minh City: 62.27% of the province falls within the pollution buffer area with an estimated 5.3 million residents.
2. Ha Noi: 29.70% with 2.2 million residents.
3. Dong Nai: 24.75% with 763,691 residents affected.

### Recommendation

Lastly, we analysed the top three plants with the most affected population. All three of which are located in Ho Chih Minh City and use fossil fuel as the primary energy source. Vietnamese officials should consider replacing these three power plants with renewable energy source to reduce the population affected by the pollution.
